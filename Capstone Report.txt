Introduction/Business Problem 


Imagine a person seeking a home or apartment in the city of Denver who does not know which neighborhood will best match their interests and wants. The realty company which could provide them a tool to search the businesses of every Denver neighborhood and rank those neighborhoods based on the density of certain business types would be the obvious choice for their realty business. Take for example a prospective homeowner who wants to live in a neighborhood with a wide range of available fitness centers, and also a wide range of choice in italian food. A tool which could rank neighborhoods based on the overall amount of these business types within a neighborhood would provide your customer with the ideal method of honing their search.


Data
Utilizing geodata from Open Data Soft on Colorado postal codes and their respective latitude/longitude we can create a map of every distinct neighborhood in the Denver metropolitan area. Combining this with foursquare business/venue data we can create a combined data table of the amount of every business type within the city. Then, with this table’s data normalized we can then create a dotted heat map of the Denver area which will indicate where the selected business type is most common.


This Open Data Soft data is contained within this github project under the name “us-zip-code.csv”.
